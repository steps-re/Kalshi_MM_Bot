# Research notes — measured signals beyond passive quoting

Working notes for strategy development. Everything here is measured, with the
instrument and sample stated, because this project has repeatedly discovered
that unstated methodology is where the errors live.

## Live markout by window phase (n=164 live fills, 2026-08-17)

| time left | n | mean | median | in favour |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 12-15m | 29 | +0.414c | +0.500c | 72% |
| 9-12m | 79 | +0.416c | +0.500c | 75% |
| 6-9m | 56 | +0.185c | +0.150c | 66% |
| 0-6m | 0 | — | — | — |

Two things. The early window is our *best* regime live, which contradicts the
polled-era backtest bucket (12m+ mean −0.53c) — that number was built on
unknown-horizon markout from 1%-resolution data and loses to live evidence.
And the final six minutes are completely unexplored: every live run started at
window open with a ~7 minute duration. Depth collapses ~11x into the close, so
this is not a small gap.

## Mid-price momentum inside a window (13 window paths, canonical mid series)

Conditional on a ≥1c mid move over 30 seconds, the next 30 seconds:

- continues in the same direction **74%** of the time (n=42)
- moves a further **+2.91c mean / +1.85c median** in the trigger's direction

Measured from `BacktestResult.mid_series` over the 7 websocket-era feed
recordings — not from a hand-rolled book reconstruction (the first attempt at
one self-crossed within 30s and produced nothing; use the canonical machinery).

Implications, in order of confidence:

1. **Defence.** The worst markout tails (−1c to −7.5c) are consistent with
   resting through exactly these moves. Pulling or skewing quotes for ~60s
   after a 1c/30s trigger converts the fat left tail into avoided fills. This
   is a parameter-sized change to the market maker, not a new strategy.
2. **Offence.** +2.9c expected continuation against a taker fee of 1.75c at
   the midpoint — and 0.04–0.6c in the tails, which is where momentum
   converges as windows resolve. A small taker strategy triggered by the same
   signal is plausibly positive after fees, and unlike market making it is not
   queue-constrained, so it scales in size where the MM cannot.
3. n=42 across 13 windows in one afternoon. Direction is credible; magnitude
   is soft. Both firm up for free as the collector accumulates windows.

## Venue asymmetry (n=110 live fills)

ETH15M: +0.352c mean, 80% favourable, queue depth ~7 contracts.
BTC15M: +0.161c mean, 46% favourable, queue depth ~1,690 contracts.

The thin market is the better market: we sit at the front of a short queue and
the flow that reaches us is less informed. Sizing should follow — ETH first,
BTC smaller, not symmetric.
